Some tea.

This week I start work for iNovo again. iNovo is a outsource project I work for a friend.

I work for it almost 16 month because my friend has nothing experiece of app outsource, UI,funtion and some other things were change many many times.

And this week when I start this project again, latest commit is 5 month ago. I found I do code far better than before, I delete many code.

Feel good.
